✅ Your Current Plan — Why It’s Strong:
🔹 Frontend:

    Add Users dynamically — scalable user interface ✔️

    Live Heartbeat Chart — real-time visualization ✔️

    Anomaly Injection Button — simulates real-world irregularities ✔️

    Per-user display — handles multiple data streams ✔️

🔹 Backend:

    Heartbeat Data Stream per User — emulates device feed ✔️

    Anomaly Detection Logic — triggers conditionally ✔️

    Storing Data with SQL — ensures persistence and future querying ✔️

    Endpoints for each user — supports frontend flexibility ✔️

🧱 Suggested Structure

Here’s how you can build this out further step-by-step:
1. User Management (Backend & DB)

    Table: Users — id, name, created_at, etc.

    Table: Heartbeats — user_id, timestamp, bpm, anomaly_type

    API: /add_user, /data/<uid>, /inject_anomaly/<uid>

2. Data Generation & Anomaly Simulation

Use:

    neurokit2 or

    [wfdb with MIT-BIH data]

For each user:

    Stream normal BPM from a simulator or dataset

    On "Anomaly" button press → inject a PAC/PVC (as you’re doing)

3. Analysis Pipeline

Backend functions to:

    Detect BPM spikes/drops

    Classify anomalies (e.g. PVC, Tachycardia, etc.)

    Store analysis messages in a table like HealthEvents

Optional:

    Use [scikit-learn] or [tsfresh] later for anomaly detection

4. Frontend Dashboard Enhancements

    Display:

        Live BPM

        Recent Anomalies

        Summary Analysis

    Add:

        Download data CSV

        Patient notes/comments

        ECG waveform view (with canvas or D3)

Optimize - When adding new user, it is a little slow. Need to optimize this.
