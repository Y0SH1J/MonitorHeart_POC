- Start with making a virtual environment. Why? Because the more projects you work on, there is a chance that different versions of python or libraries or dependencies maybe need to be used.
So we have independent group of libraries something which ensures that the libraries and dependencies do not clash with each other.

py -3 -m venv .venv (Only for creating virtual environment)
.venv\Scripts\activate (For activating the environment)
deactivate (For exiting the environment)
